## Test for Chas Visual Management


### Description
I've mainly made use of flexbox for the site layout, in order for elements to wrap nicely on smaller screens. This worked well except in one case (see below). As for the HTML, I've just tried to keep it semantically correct.

### Improvements
If I had extra time, I would have liked to find a solution for wrapping the filters and "add image"-button (the elements between the page logo and the gallery). I tried to work it out with flexbox, reversing the order of these elements when they start wrapping in order to position the button on top of the menu. However, this affected the margins between the button and the bottom border on larger screens, as well as the alignment of the filters and the bottom border. Suggestions are very welcome!
